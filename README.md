# Simon Says

**Simon Says** is a simple command-line pattern recollection game that is so old in concept I'm sure its bones have disintegrated into powder and blown across the wind to the long, forgotten past.

Still, it's a fun game to play in Ruby when you need some amusement on the command line.

## Usage

```
ruby play-simon.rb
```

Optional difficulty level parameter: 1 - Easy (default), 2 - Moderate, 3 - Hard.

```
ruby play-simon.rb 2
```

Good skill!
